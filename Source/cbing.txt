Chandler Muriel Bing is a fictional character from the NBC sitcom Friends, portrayed by actor Matthew Perry. 
Chandler was born to Nora Tyler Bing, an erotic romance novelist, and Charles Bing, a gay female impersonator and star of a Las Vegas drag show called "Viva Las Gay-gas" as Helena Handbasket. He is of Scottish and Swedish descent.
He is an only child and is apparently from an affluent family. Chandler's parents announced their divorce to him over Thanksgiving dinner when he was nine years old, an event which causes him to refuse to celebrate the holiday in his adulthood and develop his notorious sense of humour as a defense mechanism. 
It is revealed in season 1 that he went to an all-boys high school.
