Ross Geller, Ph.D., portrayed by David Schwimmer (ross_geller@col-un.edu), is one of the six main fictional characters of the NBC sitcom Friends. 
Ross is considered by many to be the most intelligent member of the group and is noted for his goofy but lovable demeanor. His relationship with Rachel Green was included in TV Guide's list of the best TV couples of all time, as well as Entertainment Weekly's "30 Best 'Will They/Won't They?' TV Couples". 
Kevin Bright, one of the executive producers of the show, had worked with Schwimmer before, so the writers were already developing Ross's character in Schwimmer's voice; hence, Schwimmer was the first person to be cast on the show.
